        "Que 1. What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
        "- Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two quantitative variables: one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable (response). The purpose of SLR is to estimate how the dependent variable changes as the independent variable changes, and to make predictions or forecasts based on this relationship. The model fits a straight line (regression line) to the data, usually using the least squares method, to minimize the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values."
